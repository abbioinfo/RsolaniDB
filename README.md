# RsolaniDB 
Creating local (offline) copy of the database

## About the database
*Rhizoctonia solani KÃ¼hn* (teleomorph: Thanatephorus cucumeris [Frank] Donk) is a collective name for a group of ubiquitous, soilborne and multinucleate basidiomycetous fungi, which are classified into 13 Anastomosis Groups (AGs) with interspecific subgroups having distinctive morphology, pathogenicity and heterogenous genetic composition. Here, we performed comprehensive genome sequencing, assembly, annotation and pangenome functional analysis of 12 *R. solani* isolates covering 7 AGs and selected sub-groups (AG1-IA, AG1-IB, AG1-IC, AG2-2IIIB, AG3-PT, AG3-TB, AG4-HG-I, AG5, AG6, and AG8). The results and datasets are compiled as a user-friendly database to host a large repertoire of reference-quality R. solani genomes and their annotated gene models. The genomes of six previously reported R. solani isolates by other research groups are also included in this database. The database stands as a valuable platform for hosting, visualizing, and analyzing highly diverse genome assemblies and their annotated components, with tools for gene enrichment & pathway analysis, sequence retrieval and visualization. Since most of the genomes are reported for the first time, the genomes, gene models and the database can be a useful resource for formulating novel hypotheses across the highly complex pathosystems of *R. solani*  AGs and sub-groups with distinct host preferences.
